++High Score link to top left.

--Entire Quiz (cry)
CSS'd popups under a line after inputting answer.
Go Back (++) and Clear Highscore button (--) on the High Score page.
0) I'm not sure if I should be splitting the js files into one per html file.
1) The questions and the answer options need to appear and disappear as you proceed through the quiz, and I'm not sure what technique to use, either writing HTML via JS, or using like, .setAttribute("class", hidden")
2) The answers should be 4 clickable buttons with responses based on whether they're correct or not, and a message of "correct" or "wrong" under them, as you proceed through the quiz
3) The buttons should be stylized.
4) The timer needs to stop when the quiz is complete and prompt for entry of initials that rejects bad input and .toUpperCase() lowercase
5) The scores are like, stored as arrays in localStorage and need to be sortable so that only the top 10 appear
